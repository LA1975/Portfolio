# Portfolio

A work in progress

My first iteration of a portfolio website.
- responsive
- social contact buttons always visible
- use DOM manipulation from JS to load profile cards information from array based on size. 
- basic animation features: 
  - hamburger to cross
  - text fades in via random letters. 
  - light and dark mode

Parts still todo:
Portfolio section:
    Alot of my projects are from assignments so they are in private repositories.
    Problem: how to make viewable from portfolio?
      Possible Solutions:
       1- copy and paste into new public repositories to make code accessible to view
            PROS: little time and effort, easily create a github page to link to.
            CONS: would be easily searchable and could compromise academic credibility of university course if they reuse assignments for future intakes.
       
       2- create a summary page for each project with screen shots of code.
            PROS: able to display work with limiting searchabilty of assignments of future students as long as written content avoided ket terms in common.
            CONS: more time intensive  - multiple methods to choose from:
            - if choose this do I:
                1- create a page per project on profile site
                2- create a template page (handlebars?) that pulls info from JSON
                3- create a template page that  putts info from database
                  Hosting?
                  If I choose 3 can I host SQLite easily?
                  
                  
Contact section:
    Need to be able to be contacted by credible people not bots, creepos or spammers.
    Uncomfortable putting too much personal contact info up - woman on the internet issues.
