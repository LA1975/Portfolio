# Portfolio

## A work in progress

My first iteration of a portfolio website.
- responsive
- social contact buttons always visible
- use DOM manipulation from JS to load profile cards information from array based on size. 
- basic animation features: 
  - hamburger to cross
  - text fades in via random letters. 
  - light and dark mode
- portfolio project links to gitHub (considered doing within website or use a database but decided to keep static)
  - university projects private repos so created a reflection only repository.
## Todo List:

**Portfolio section**

-add more projects to this section

                  
                  
**Contact section**

  Removed for now. Need to be able to be contacted by credible people not bots, creepos or spammers.
  Uncomfortable putting too much personal contact online.
