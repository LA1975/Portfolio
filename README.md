# Portfolio

A work in progress

My first iteration of a portfolio website.
- responsive
- social contact buttons always visible
- use DOM manipulation from JS to load profile cards information from array based on size.
- basic animation features: 
  - hamburger to cross
  - text fades in via random letters.
